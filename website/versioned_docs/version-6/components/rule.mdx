title: Rule
description: Layout and config component for rules
---

The `Rule` component represents query conditions. `Rule` calls the [`useRule`](../utils/hooks#userule) hook to prepare the subcomponent props.

## Subcomponents

`Rule` renders elements in this order:

- Drag handle[^1]
- Field selector
- Operator selector[^2]
- Value source selector[^3] [^4]
- Value editor[^4]
- Clone rule button[^5]
- Lock rule button[^6]
- Remove rule button

[^1]: Only rendered if [`enableDragAndDrop`](./querybuilder#enabledraganddrop) is `true`.
[^2]: Only rendered if [`autoSelectField`](./querybuilder#autoselectfield) is `true` or the rule's `field` doesn't match `translations.fields.placeholderName`.
[^3]: Only rendered if the rule's `operator` is neither `"null"` nor `"notNull"` and the derived `valueSources` array has more than one element.
[^4]: Only rendered when (1) the `arity` property of the rule's `operator` is not `"unary"` or `< 2`, and (2) [`autoSelectOperator`](./querybuilder#autoselectoperator) is `true` _or_ the rule's `operator` doesn't match `translations.operators.placeholderName`.
[^5]: Only rendered if [`showCloneButtons`](./querybuilder#showclonebuttons) is `true`.
[^6]: Only rendered if [`showLockButtons`](./querybuilder#showlockbuttons) is `true`.
