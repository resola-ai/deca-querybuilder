While the `id` property can uniquely identify a rule or group, an `id` won't naturally indicate anything about the _position_ of the object within the query hierarchy. For that reason, React Query Builder uses the concept of a "path" to locate and update query objects.

The `path` property is an array of integers unique to each rule and group within a query. The query object itself, aka the root group, has a `path` of `[]`. All other rules and groups within the query have a `path` that corresponds to their position within the `rules` array(s) of their ancestor group(s).

The `path` of any object (rule or group) is equivalent to the `path` of its parent group plus another array element which is the index of the object within its parent's `rules` array. You can think of it like this: `path = [...parentPath, index]`.

Consider the following query. The respective `path` for each rule and group is commented above it, along with a short explanation.

```ts
// [] (the root group)
const query: RuleGroupType = {
  combinator: 'and',
  rules: [
    // [0] (the first, aka zeroth, element in the root rules array)
    { field: 'f1', operator: '=', value: 'v1' },
    // [1] (the second element in the root rules array is a sub-group)
    {
      combinator: 'or',
      rules: [
        // [1, 0] (the first element within the rules array
        //         of the group occupying the second position
        //         in the root rules array)
        { field: 'f2', operator: '=', value: 'v2' },
        // [1, 1] (the second element within the rules array
        //         of the group occupying the second position
        //         in the root rules array)
        { field: 'f3', operator: '=', value: 'v3' },
      ],
    },
  ],
};
```

The `path` of the top-most rule in the query is `[0]`, `0` being the index of that rule within the root group's `rules` array. The `path` of the first sub-group in the query is `[1]`, again according to its index within the outermost `rules` array. Each child rule of _that_ group has a path that begins with `1` (the `path` of its parent), followed by its own index.

## Finding a `path`

Use the [`findPath`](../utils/misc#findpath) function to locate a specific rule or group for examination or update. Given the query above:

```ts
findPath([1, 0], query);
```

would return this object:

```json
{ "field": "f2", "operator": "=", "value": "v2" }
```

## Example

In most scenarios you won't need to interact with the `path` attribute, but it can come in handy in certain situations. One such situation is if you need to access other parts of the query from within a custom component.

:::tip

By default, custom components only receive props relevant to the rule or group they act on, but you can augment these default props with other data or information by using the [`context` prop](../components/querybuilder#context).

:::

Say you have a custom value editor that needs to know the `value` of each of its sibling rules. We would recommend passing the entire query down through the `context` prop and retrieving the sibling rules with a combination of `getParentPath` and `findPath`.

```tsx CustomValueEditor.tsx
import {
  findPath,
  getParentPath,
  RuleGroupType,
  RuleType,
  ValueEditor,
  ValueEditorProps,
} from 'react-querybuilder';

export const CustomValueEditor = (props: ValueEditorProps) => {
  // Get the path of this rule's parent group
  const parentPath = getParentPath(props.path);
  // Find the parent group object in the query
  const parentGroup = findPath(parentPath, props.context.query) as RuleGroupType;
  const id = findPath(props.path, props.context.query)!.id;
  // Get a comma-separated list of all sibling rule values
  const siblingValues = (
    parentGroup.rules.filter(
      r =>
        // filter out groups
        !('rules' in r) &&
        // filter out self
        r.id !== id
    ) as RuleType[]
  )
    // map the `value` property
    .map(r => r.value)
    // join with comma
    .join(', ');

  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column' }}>
      <ValueEditor {...props} />
      <span>Others: {siblingValues}</span>
    </div>
  );
};
```

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { QueryBuilder } from 'react-querybuilder';
import { CustomValueEditor } from './CustomValueEditor';
import { defaultQuery, fields, operators } from './constants';

export default function App() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState(defaultQuery);

  return (
    <QueryBuilder
      fields={fields}
      operators={operators}
      query={query}
      onQueryChange={q => setQuery(q)}
      controlElements={{ valueEditor: CustomValueEditor }}
      context={{ query }}
    />
  );
}
```

```ts constants.ts
import { defaultOperators, Field, RuleGroupType } from 'react-querybuilder';

export const operators = defaultOperators.filter(op => op.name === '=');

export const fields: Field[] = [
  { name: 'field1', label: 'Field 1' },
  { name: 'field2', label: 'Field 2' },
  { name: 'field3', label: 'Field 3' },
  { name: 'field4', label: 'Field 4' },
];

export const defaultQuery: RuleGroupType = {
  combinator: 'and',
  rules: [
    { field: 'field1', operator: '=', value: '1' },
    { field: 'field2', operator: '=', value: '2' },
    { field: 'field3', operator: '=', value: '3' },
    { field: 'field4', operator: '=', value: '4' },
  ],
};
```

```css
.queryBuilder .rule {
  align-items: flex-start;
